Ahoy!  
My name is Bernardas Ali≈°auskas and I am a Lithuanian currently living in Thailand.

I love programming, free software and all of the techy, nerdy stuff! So that's what I'm keen on writing on.  
Checkout the [category](/category.html) and [tags](/tags.html) page for a general gist of what this blog contains and feel free to leave a comment! 

Currently, I'm working on a side project of mine - a education blog on web-scraping at <https://scrapecrow.com>

Lastly, if you'd like to contact me you can find me at: <bernardas.alisauskas@pm.me> or on matrix: <https://matrix.to/#/@wraptile:matrix.org>
