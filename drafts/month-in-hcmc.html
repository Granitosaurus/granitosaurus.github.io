        <p>Ho Chi Minh City - previously known as Saigon and renamed after communist revolution leader of vietnam after great reunification of South and North Vietnam.
Both names are very much accepted, interchangable and there doesn't seem to be any political tension regarding the name. In fact there's very little political tension regarding anything in general.</p>

        <h1 id="weather">Weather</h1>
<p>We arrived at HCMC in late November, just 10 hours ago we were in snowy cold Helsinki and now we stepped out of the airport and instantly felt the heat and humidity of south vietnamese weather.
It was really humid. I've tried to research statistics for the blog but I felt that the numbers just failed to represent how it actually feels - so you'll just have to take my word for it on this one.</p>
<p><img alt="weather stats for hcmc" src="https://granitosaurus.github.io/images/hcmc_weather.png"/></p>
<p>Temperature in Ho Chi Minh City (and sounds Vietnam in general) is very much the same all year round,
however some days are very humid, making sweat hard to evaporate thus making you feel
that it's significantly hotter than it actually is.
Most of the inside places are running heavy air conditioning so it was pretty funny to see people
wearing hats and winter jackets when it's 30&deg; outside.
Movie theaters in particular are chilly, so packing a hoodie is vital!</p>
<p>Regarding rain - Saigon has two seasons: wet and dry. We arrived at the end of November when
wet season was at the very end thus we haven't encountered much rain. There were few "flash pours"
when there was big bursts of rain coming down for few minutes but it was really rare.</p>
<p>Saigon in general was pretty foggy and overcast most of the time, except for early morning where occasionally you could get a real sun-burn!</p>
<h3 id="air quality">Air Quality</h3>
<p>If you've seen and/or been in Asia you're probably familiar with the smog, dust and facemasks people wear.
Saigon being a huge ass city that is still under heavily development is no exception. It's smoggy, dusty and humid - but for some reason it feels ok. I don't particularly have a sensitive nose but my acne wasn't too happy about the the sudden changes!</p>
<h1 id="where to stay_1">Where to stay</h1>
<p>We stayed Tanh Binh district, a developing district near the district 1, which is center district of Saigon. We primarily chose it because we found a good deal on airbnb and it was close to district 1. After spending there a month I wouldn't recommend it and instead recommend choosing D1, D3 or D5 which all near each other.</p>
<p><img alt="HCMC districts" src="https://granitosaurus.github.io/images/hcmc_districts.png"/></p>
<p><em>Quick tip: if you want to visualise the districts on the map just use term <code>district x hcmc</code> in google maps</em></p>
<p>The problem with Tanh Binh district is mostly the traffic. Saigon is notorious for messy traffic but Tanh Binh district is completely impossible to navigate on foot. Not only that but unless you take uber/grab bike it'll take you at least half an hour to get to district 1. Also vegetarian food (and good food in general) was difficult to find.
There are some advantages though:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drinks and food is cheaper at cafes compared to more central districts.</li>
<li>10 min uber ride close to nice shopping centers like "Saigonres Plaza" and "Pearl Plaza".</li>
<li>Several decent PC bangs in the area.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally if I were to go for another month I'd stay in District 3 - it's close to D1 and has a bunch of activities in it on it's own, so you have a bunch of things in walking distance.</p>

<h1 id="where and what to rent">Where and what to rent</h1>
<p>For short/medium term rents we pretty much came down to three places:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://airbnb.com">Airbnb.com</a> - while it is pricier than looking than majority of other sources it's well worth the convenience tax. You can see the amenities apartments have, exact amount you'll be charged and a bunch of other info. Usually places have discounts for weekly and monthly rents and you can even contact host and ask them to reduce that. Also you should <strong>be on a lookout for new postings</strong>, they're a bit riskier but can end up being significantly cheaper (that's were we stayed).</li>
<li><a href="http://hotelscombined.com">Hotelscombined.com</a> - it's a hotel aggregator and you could potentially find good deals, especially if you look around 1-2 weeks before your trip. To add to that hotels usually come with decent breakfast.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.expat.com/en/housing/asia/vietnam/ho-chi-minh-city/">Expat.com</a> - a lot of cheaper options, though it's a bit hard to navigate and good part of postings are long duration only (2 months+ usually).</li>
</ol>
<p>For things to look in an apartment:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are looking to <strong>save money</strong> I'd advise get something with a <strong>kitchen</strong> because food at supermarkets is dirt cheap. While food in the city center (District 1 etc.) restaurants can get quite pricey - 100k+(4&euro;) per dish and the portions tend to be quite small, while the same can be made in your kitchen for 1/4th of the price. Even if you skip kitchen you can get some good instant ramen (lots of great vietnamese and korean import options) and other premade foods as long as you get a water boiler. You can actually get a rice cooker for 15&euro; or so and make some easy rice meals.</li>
<li>Some sort of <strong>garden or sit-down area</strong> is a nice thing to have, or just more space in the apartment. This is especially true if your stay is longer - getting out every day can be very tiring and expensive to boot, so an ability to do some work or just spend some time at home can be very valuable. To add to that HCMC doesn't have much greenery despite the fact that it's located in a country with literal jungles.</li>
<li><strong>Dryer</strong> is amazing thing to have. Saigon is extremely humid so be prepared to wear damp clothes on a daily basis, unless you have a dryer or at least a place to dry your clothes. Not only it's humid but you might get caught in flash rain attacks that last just few minutes but can easily get you soaking wet if you get caught out in the open.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="prices">Prices</h1>
<p>Vietnamese currency is called Dongs (VND) and it comes with a lot of zeroes. Good conversion rate ir <strong>3.7&euro; equals 100 000 dongers</strong>, however if you take conversion fees and such into account you can pretty accurately assume it actually 4&euro; = 100.000 VND.</p>
<p>Needless to say even the poorest of vietnamese are millionaires and so were we! There are no coins and the lowest bill is a 500 one (which is really rare) which is around 2 euro cents.</p>
<p><img src="https://granitosaurus.github.io/gifs/simpsons_money.gif" title="Imagine exchanging 500&euro; to 500 dong bills! That's almost 30k money bills! "/></p>
<p>It might seem confusing at first but you get used to it rather quickly as pricing is at most in triple digits. For example cup of coffee is usually priced at 25-50k VND.</p>
<p>Generally HCMC is quite cheap, however various expenses can easily add up especially if you live in the city center and eat out every day. Good 60% of our expenses was mostly food.<br/>
Some tips for avoiding overspending:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coffee especially is very pricey, especially for vietnamese standards. The price ranges from 30 to 60k(1 - 2.5&euro;). You can make great coffee at home by getting a reusable vietnamese filter called "phin" (~30k) and some delicious vietnamese coffee (price varies from 50-200k/100g, though even 50k ones tastes great).  </li>
<li>You can save on food by eating out at more simple cafeteria like places. There are some places that will charge you 50k for a huge portion of rice/noodles with vegetables. Unfortunately it's pretty hard to find good ones if you have some dietary preferences (e.g. vegetarian or just don't like egg) and usually they are rarely listed on google maps and such and if they are, they don't have much info.  </li>
<li>
<p>Use Uber or Grab (it's an south-east asian uber-like service) to get around instead of a taxi. Not only it's cheaper but will help you avoid scams and communication errors.</p>
<p>There's hardly a difference between Grab and Uber prices except for when Uber goes on a "Surge" (higher demand) mode, but that's pretty rare. Other than that you can consider taking Uber/Grab bike if you're alone and brave enough - not only it's half the price but it'll get you where you need to go in half the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get a place closer to the inner city (or things relevant to you) because logistic expenses quickly add up (not to mention getting around because of horrendous traffic takes a long time).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outside from fixed price places make sure to bargain, usually things are being offered at double the price of what they are willing to sell it for so you can just start by offering half and going from there.</p>
<p>Don't be afraid to walk away, they'll either call you back and offer it for your price or you can try again at place next door that sells the same things. Though it's important to remember that the 10k you'd get off means a lot more to them than to you so you shouldn't overdo it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="working">Working</h1>
<p>I'm working remotely at a Lithuanian company as a software engineer full time. So I had to get good amount of work every day.<br/>
I'm usually not very susceptible to jet lag but the 20 hour long trip combined with extreme weather changes made me very jet lagged, to the point where it took me 2 weeks or so just to get a proper working schedule going.  </p>
<p>For working environment Saigon is pretty okay in overall: </p>
<ul>
<li>The internet is good and wifi is everywhere. <br/>
   While the speeds won't blow your hat off they are still plentiful to do work, usually speed-test would return me 20mpbs up/down at 100-200ms latency to european servers - which is pretty good all things considered. To add to that mobile internet is good as well, we've got a pair of unlimited mobifone sims 180k dongs each  (7&euro;) for our stay and the speeds weren't too far away from available wifi, so setting up a hotspot is definitely an option.</li>
<li>Plenty of caf&eacute;s and restaurants to work from however vietnamese really like their hard chairs so if you're looking for butt-luxuries you will have to look around a bit. Also drinks tend to be overpriced - around 40-50k a pop.  </li>
<li>Plenty of shared workspaces - coworker.com <a href="https://www.coworker.com/search/ho-chi-minh-city/vietnam">lists 29 spaces in Ho Chi Minh City</a> which are priced at 100-200k/day with significant weekly/monthly discounts. This is a very good deal if you're planning to stay for several months as these places usually cover drinks and offer other amenities (like monitors, cables etc.) as well as connecting you with other expats if you're out to meet some people.  </li>
<li>Video conferencing was difficult - while internet is decent the latency and connection inconsistency didn't play well with major video conferencing platforms (skype, google hangouts etc.) so if big part of your work is that I'd highly recommend going to a shared workspace.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall while I did had trouble overcoming jet lag and getting my sleeping schedule sorted for efficient work-flow I did overcome it and after 2 weeks I rarely had issues with working remotely from Saigon.  </p>
<h1 id="getting sick, insurance and all that adult stuff">Getting Sick, Insurance and all that Adult stuff</h1>
<p><img src="https://granitosaurus.github.io/gifs/ren_sick.gif" title="being sick in a completely foreign environment sucks"/></p>
<p>You'll probably get sick in Saigon, well I'm convinced about that, unless you are coming from a very similar environment you'll at least get the poops once in a while, so better prepare for that.<br/>
While there are plenty of pharmacies around they aren't even remotely close to western standards. Unless you call in a doctor you'll have to do your own research of what medicine you need as pharmacists have questionable education at best. There are no regulations either, so really strong, hospital-grade medicine and even antibiotics are available on the shelf and you almost certainly don't want those.<br/>
So pack in some basic medicines for fever, headaches, diarrhea and what-not - especially if you're traveling alone.  </p>
<p>Regarding insurance we found it to be surprisingly affordable once you start digging around, however there are some important caveats to consider. We got 6 months of insurance for two from an estonian insurance company Ergo for a bit over 500&euro;, while a lot of "nomad" and other "specialized" insurance companies charged double or triple that - don't fall for trendy marketing and just look around your general, reputable insurance companies.   </p>
<p>One thing to consider is that insurance people are a bunch fucking snakes and their whole business is based around this, so do your homework here. For example our insurance considers hiking and trekking as an extreme sport and charges almost 30% extra for that, as well as other small details that might be important. When it comes to customizing the insurance we did chose a plan that doesn't cover small &lt;25&euro; expenses which drop the price significantly, honestly it's probably not worth dealing with insurance bureaucracy for micro-payments.   </p>
<p><em>while Saigon isn't much for hiking the rest of Vietnam is just full of great hiking, biking and canoeing opportunities!</em> </p>
<p>Nevertheless I'd advise getting insured just for the peace of mind.</p>
<h1 id="great things about saigon">Great things about Saigon</h1>
<p>Saigon is a very interesting city. It's huge, under heavy development and yet still has plenty to do and see.</p>
<h1 id="not so great things about saigon">Not so great things about Saigon</h1>
<p>While I enjoyed spending a month in HCMC I'd probably wouldn't want to stay there long term (especially after seeing the rest of Vietnam). Here are some of the reasons why:</p>
<h3 id="logistics hell">Logistics Hell</h3>
<p>Saigon is widely considered to have the worst traffic in the world and while there are great arguments against that it's hard to claim that the system needs no improvement. Fortunately a new metro system is being built to somewhat relieve this issue, though it is set to launch only in 2020 or so.</p>
<p>The biggest problem is that navigating on foot is nigh on impossible on some places, unless you fancy of role-playing a car and just straight up walking on the road. The sidewalks are tiny and to add to that they are used as a public space rather than a dedicated section for moving around. There are scooters parked, people setting up shops as well as restaurants setting up tables and such, people just doing general things like repairing their scooters; doing welding or spray-painting; washing their dishes or preparing food.</p>
<p>I think it's pretty fair to say that sidewalks as a thing we have in western world doesn't exist in Saigon except for few select places. This makes me think that the metro system will be a huge failure since why would anyone take a metro ride from point A to B when the last few hundred meters would still need to be covered by foot, which is unpleasant at best and close to impossible at worst.</p>
<h3 id="it's dirty">It's Dirty</h3>
<p>The city is still under heavy development at places but with so many people it can get quite unpleasant and just sad at times. Plastic usage is down-right mindless - let's say you buy cold tea as takeaway, you'll get some tea in a plastic cup, a straw, a spoon and all that will also be bagged up in a plastic bag. Since they don't have any taxes on plastic bags they are everywhere and on everything.</p>
<p>There are rarely any trash bins around so people throw things on the ground in hopes that it will be cleaned up by people who go around collecting trash, but more often than not this trash just ends up in the nearby river or a pond.</p>
<p>At first I thought it was like this because of the sheer amount of people the city has to accommodate, but after spending some time you can see that it's a clear culture and policy issue. People just don't care much about it, neither does the government. <em>We've seen some attention regarding this in Hanoi (like posters and trash pickup parties) but not in Saigon, hopefully this movement spreads down south too</em></p>
<h3 id="surprisingly expensive and touristy">Surprisingly Expensive and Touristy</h3>
<p>If you're expect some remote and cheap place to do remote work Saigon is probably not it.</p>
